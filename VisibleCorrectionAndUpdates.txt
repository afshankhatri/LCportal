in regi. as soon as the person click on hod or studnet it should open 1 more question that is dept. it should go of it person click librarian or accounts as dept. belongs to students and hod only .

at some user or student table in database the email's detatype is given as int instead of varchar ,make it proper.





in accounts and in library the view details is not working properly

UPDATES:

 now we need to work on ... giving final dates to the students ,for collecting the LC 


also if the formis rejected then the interface for the student to make the necessary changes 

also display of remark given at the time of rejectioin should be displayed to the student so that he can make the necessary changes and resubmit the form

//IMPORTANT UPDATE
accepted rejected button not working properly in viewDetsils popup ... because the scene is that when we accept or reject the user the code does not acc/rej the particular selected student ... it updates the 1st person in the list instead of the selected person  ... if we acc/rej directly from outside it work properly
basically the issue is with the rejection model in the view-details section  ... outside it is working properly
