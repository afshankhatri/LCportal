in regi. as soon as the person click on hod or studnet it should open 1 more question that is dept. it should go of it person click librarian or accounts as dept. belongs to students and hod only .

at some user or student table in database the email's detatype is given as int instead of varchar ,make it proper.





in accounts and in library the view details is not working properly

UPDATES:

also if the formis rejected then the interface for the student to make the necessary changes 


//IMPORTANT UPDATEs

make the re-apply button working (it is just added on the interface ,not functional)...
for re-apply ask the teacher what the students needs to do if rejected for each particular authority ... if rejected by hod then what similarly for acc and lib
